                SearchDeck's advanced search feature utilizes advanced search operators, also known as Google dorking. These filters allow you to specify sites, keywords, and text to include or exclude, and to refine searches by language, country, and search engine. This enables precise, tailored searches, ensuring you quickly find the most relevant information.

                The Saved Searches feature allows you to keep track of and revisit your previous search queries. Each saved search displays key details, including the query text, date and time of the search, and the search engine used (e.g., Google, Bing). You can filter through saved searches using the search bar at the top, making it easy to find specific queries. This feature ensures that important searches are easily accessible for future reference and analysis.
